# ResonantOS

**Resonant Open System Toolkit (Multi-Agent AI)** - The First OS for AI Agent Economies

> Building tools for augmentation, not replacement.

## What is ResonantOS?

ResonantOS is an operating system layer that runs on top of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot). Not a fork, not a replacement.

Think of it as: **macOS to Unix**, or **Ubuntu to Linux kernel**. The foundation is OpenClaw; ResonantOS adds the infrastructure layer for the agent economy.

## ResonantOS vs. OpenClaw

| Feature | OpenClaw | ResonantOS |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Multi-agent orchestration | Core feature | OpenClaw + enhanced coordination |
| 🧠 **R-Memory** | Basic context | Advanced memory with compression, retrieval, persistent context across sessions |
| 💉 **R-Awareness** | Manual prompting | Intelligent context injection — right knowledge, right time, automatic |
| 🛡️ **Symbiotic Shield** | — | Security daemon: permission validation, sandboxing, code scanning |
| ⚖️ **Logician** | — | Deterministic rule enforcement: provable policies, audit trails, cost checks |
| 🐕 **Watchdog** | Manual restart | Self-healing infrastructure: auto-recovery, health monitoring, incident logs |
| 🔗 **DAO Integration** | — | On-chain governance: community decisions, blockchain transparency |
| 💰 **Crypto Wallet** | — | Native Solana wallet: token economy, seamless value flow |
| 💬 **Chatbot Deployment** | — | Embed AI chatbots on any website: generate code from dashboard, paste, done |
| 📊 **Dashboard** | OpenClaw dashboard | Mission Control UI: create chatbots, monitor agents, manage everything |
| 🔄 **A2A Protocols** | — | Agent-to-agent: service discovery, payments, marketplace |
| 🖥️ **Computer Control** | Browser, shell, canvas | OpenClaw + mobile device control |
| 📱 **Telegram Integration** | Single bot | Multi-bot per agent |
| 📦 **Installation** | CLI setup | One-click DMG installer |

**Bottom line:** ResonantOS = OpenClaw + security (Shield) + governance (Logician) + self-healing (Watchdog) + memory (R-Memory) + awareness (R-Awareness) + chatbot deployment + crypto wallet + DAO + agent economy protocols.

## Philosophy

ResonantOS is built on **Augmentatism** - the belief that the future belongs to human-AI collaboration, not competition. We're not building replacements. We're building partners.

- **Connection over isolation**
- **Sovereignty over dependence**
- **Friction as signal, not obstacle**

---

## Current Status

🚧 **In Development** - Public beta March 2026

We're building:
- ✅ Core multi-agent system (operational)
- 🔄 macOS installer (in progress)
- 📝 DAO governance (spec phase)
- 📐 Agent marketplace (design phase)
