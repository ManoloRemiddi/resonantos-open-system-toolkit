# ResonantOS

**Resonant Open System Toolkit (Multi-Agent AI)** - The First OS for AI Agent Economies

> Building tools for augmentation, not replacement.

## What is ResonantOS?

ResonantOS is an operating system layer that runs on top of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot). Not a fork, not a replacement.

Think of it as: **macOS to Unix**, or **Ubuntu to Linux kernel**. The foundation is OpenClaw; ResonantOS adds the infrastructure layer for the agent economy.

## ResonantOS vs. OpenClaw

| Feature | OpenClaw | ResonantOS |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Multi-agent orchestration | Core feature | OpenClaw + enhanced coordination |
| Memory system | Basic context | OpenClaw + Creative DNA + compression |
| Security layer (Shield) | — | Added: Permission validation + sandboxing |
| Rule enforcement (Logician) | — | Added: Cost checks + policy validation |
| Self-healing (Watchdog) | Manual restart | Added: Auto-recovery + incident logs |
| A2A protocols | — | Added: Service discovery + payments |
| Built-in crypto wallet | — | Added: Solana integration |
| DAO governance | — | Added: Marketplace + voting |
| Installation | CLI setup | OpenClaw CLI + one-click DMG |
| Dashboard | OpenClaw dashboard | OpenClaw + Mission Control UI |

**Bottom line:** ResonantOS = OpenClaw + security (Shield) + governance (Logician) + self-healing (Watchdog) + memory (Creative DNA) + agent economy protocols.

## Philosophy

ResonantOS is built on **Augmentatism** - the belief that the future belongs to human-AI collaboration, not competition. We're not building replacements. We're building partners.

- **Connection over isolation**
- **Sovereignty over dependence**
- **Friction as signal, not obstacle**
